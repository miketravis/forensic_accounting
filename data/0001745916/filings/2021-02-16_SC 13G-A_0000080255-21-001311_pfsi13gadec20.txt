(1)     Price Associates does not serve as custodian of the assets of any of

        client's custodian or trustee bank has the right to receive dividends
        paid with respect to, and proceeds from the sale of, such securities.

        The ultimate power to direct the receipt of dividends paid with
        respect to, and the proceeds from the sale of, such securities, is
        vested in the individual and institutional clients which Price
        Associates serves as investment adviser. Any and all discretionary
        authority which has been delegated to Price Associates may be revoked
        in whole or in part at any time.

        Except as may be indicated if this is a joint filing with one of the
        registered investment companies sponsored by Price Associates which it
        also serves as investment adviser ("T. Rowe Price Funds"), not more
        than 5% of the class of such securities is owned by any one client
        subject to the investment advice of Price Associates.

(2)     With respect to securities owned by any one of the T. Rowe Price
        Funds, only the custodian for each of such Funds, has the right to
        receive dividends paid with respect to, and proceeds from the sale of,
        such securities. No other person is known to have such right, except
        that the shareholders of each such Fund participate proportionately
        in any dividends and distributions so paid.

         By signing below I certify that, to the best of my knowledge and
         belief, the securities referred to above were acquired in the
         ordinary course of business and were not acquired and are not
         held for the purpose of or with the effect of changing or
         influencing the control of the issuer of the securities and were
         not acquired and are not held in connection with or as a participant
         in any transaction having that purpose or effect. T. Rowe Price
         Associates, Inc. hereby declares and affirms that the filing
         of Schedule 13G shall not be construed as an admission that Price
         Associates is the beneficial owner of the securities referred to,
         which beneficial ownership is expressly denied.

         Signature.

         After reasonable inquiry and to the best of my knowledge and belief,
