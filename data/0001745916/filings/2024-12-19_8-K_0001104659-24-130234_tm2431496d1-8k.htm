Agreement.</i></b></span>&#160;Pursuant to the terms of the Management Agreement, PCM manages the assets and investment strategies of
PMT. For its management services, PCM collects a base management fee and may collect a performance incentive fee. The base management
fee is payable quarterly and in arrears and the performance incentive fee is now payable annually and in arrears. The purpose of the Management
Agreement is to align the base and performance incentive components of the management fee with PMT&#8217;s investment strategies. The
Management Agreement expires, unless terminated earlier in accordance with the terms of the agreement, on December&#160;31, 2029, subject

quarter of any such issuance); plus its retained earnings at the end of the quarter; less any amount that PMT pays for repurchases or
redemptions of its equity securities (allocated on a pro rata daily basis for such repurchases and redemptions during the fiscal quarter
of any such repurchases or redemptions); and excluding one-time events pursuant to changes in GAAP and certain other non-cash charges

date, the threshold amount represents a stated return on common shareholders&#8217; equity, plus or minus a &#8220;high watermark&#8221;
adjustment. The performance fee payable for any quarter is equal to: (a)&#160;10% of the amount by which net income for the quarter exceeds
(i)&#160;an 8% return on common shareholders&#8217; equity plus the high watermark, up to (ii)&#160;a 12% return on common shareholders&#8217;

the amount by which the net income (stated as a percentage of return on common shareholders&#8217; equity) in that fiscal year exceeds
or falls short of the lesser of 8% and the Fannie Mae MBS Yield (the target yield) for such fiscal year. If the net income is lower than
the target yield, the high watermark is increased by the difference. If the net income is higher than the target yield, the high watermark
is reduced by the difference. Each time a performance incentive fee is earned, the high watermark returns to zero. As a result, the threshold
amount required for PCM to earn a performance incentive fee is adjusted cumulatively based on the performance of PMT&#8217;s net income
over (or under) the target yield, until the net income in excess of the target yield exceeds the then-current cumulative high watermark
amount, and a performance incentive fee is earned. The high watermark shall only be calculated based on the two years preceding the fiscal
year for which the incentive fee is calculated, and the high watermark shall never be less than zero after including&#160;all high watermark
increases and high watermark decreases over any such rolling two (2)&#160;fiscal year period. The performance incentive fee may be paid

<p style="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0pt 0">No automatic renewal of the MSR Recapture Agreement will occur upon
the conclusion of the initial term or any renewal period if PLS or PMT delivers to the other party a notice of nonrenewal at least 180
days in advance. In addition, (i)&#160;PLS has the right to terminate the MSR Recapture Agreement without cause if the MBS Agreement is
terminated by PMC without cause as provided in such agreement, the 5<sup>th</sup> A&amp;R Servicing Agreement is terminated by the Operating
Partnership without cause as provided in such agreement or the Management Agreement is terminated by PMT without cause as provided in
such agreement, and (ii)&#160;PMC has the right to terminate the MSR Recapture Agreement without cause if the MBS Agreement or the 5<sup>th</sup>
A&amp;R Servicing Agreement is terminated by PLS without cause as provided in each such agreement or the Management Agreement is terminated
by PCM without cause as provided in such agreement. In addition, if the Operating Partnership exercises its right to terminate the 5<sup>th</sup>
A&amp;R Servicing Agreement without cause in connection with sales of one or more mortgage loans serviced thereunder, PLS will be entitled
to terminate the MSR Recapture Agreement solely with respect to such mortgage loans. Following any termination of the MSR Recapture Agreement,
PLS is prohibited from taking action with respect to the refinancing of the mortgage loans involved in the termination, subject to various
exceptions, including an exception with respect to general advertising not targeted exclusively to the borrowers under such mortgage loans.</p>
