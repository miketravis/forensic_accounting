performance or achievements to be materially different from those set forth in the preceding forward-looking statements. Important factors that could cause our results to vary from expectations include, but are not limited to (1) our dependence on
macroeconomic and U.S. residential real estate market conditions, including changes in U.S. monetary policies that affect interest rates, (2) changes in the GSEs&#8217;, FHA, USDA and VA guidelines or GSE and Ginnie Mae guarantees, (3) our inability

Independent Mortgage Advisors, (6) the unique challenges posed to our business by the COVID-19 pandemic and the impact of governmental actions taken in response to the pandemic on our ability to originate mortgages, our servicing operations, our
liquidity and our employees, (7) the occurrence of a data breach or other failure of our cybersecurity, (8) losses of key management, (9) our inability to recover servicing advances, (10) intense competition in the mortgage industry, (11) our
ability to adapt to and implement technological change, (12) loss of intellectual property rights, (13) risks arising from the reliance on our proprietary technology to manage and grow our business, (14) risk of counterparty terminating servicing
rights and contracts, (15) our reliance on our warehouse facilities to fund mortgage loans and otherwise operate our business, leveraging of assets under these facilities and the risk of a decrease in the value of the collateral underlying certain
of our facilities causing an unanticipated margin call, (16) our ability to sell loans in the secondary market, including to the GSEs (Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac), and to securitize our loans into MBS through the GSEs and Ginnie Mae, (17) the risk
that an increase in the value of the MBSs we sell in forward markets to hedge our pipeline may result in an unanticipated margin call, (18) errors or the ineffectiveness of internal and external models we rely on to manage risk and make business
decisions, (19) noncompliance with an increasing and inconsistent body of complex laws and regulations regarding data privacy, at the U.S. federal, state and local levels, (20) our ability to continue to comply with the complex state and federal

liability to third parties as a result of a data breach or misappropriation of personal information and (22) other factors referenced in or reasonably inferred from the offering memorandum. These factors should not be construed as exhaustive and
should be read in conjunction with the other cautionary statements that are included in the offering memorandum. All of the factors are difficult to predict, contain uncertainties that may materially affect actual results, and may be beyond our
control. New factors emerge from time to time, and it is not possible for our management to predict all such factors or to assess the effect of each such new factor on our business. Although we believe that the assumptions underlying the
forward-looking statements contained herein are reasonable, any of the assumptions could be inaccurate, and therefore any of these statements included herein may prove to be inaccurate. In light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the
