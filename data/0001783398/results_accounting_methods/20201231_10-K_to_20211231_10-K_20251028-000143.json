{"20201231 10-K vs 20211231 10-K": "### **1. What are the 2 reports being compared? Reply in the following format: {Company Name}, {report type (10-K, 10-Q, etc.) of report 1} Period End Date: {period end date of report 1} and {report type (10-K, 10-Q, etc.) of report 2} Period End Date: {period end date of report 2}.**\nUWM Holdings Corporation, 10-K Period End Date: 2020-12-31 and 10-K Period End Date: 2021-12-31.\n\n### **2. List the auditor.**\nDeloitte & Touche LLP (2021 10-K, p. 73)\n\n### **3. Are there any disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures?**\nNo.\n\n### **4. Are any of the policies in the summary of significant accounting policies seen as aggressive for a company in its industry?**\nYes. On January 1, 2021, the company elected to change its accounting method for Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) from the amortized cost method to the fair value method. While permitted by GAAP, accounting for MSRs at fair value is often considered more aggressive because it introduces significant earnings volatility based on changes in management's estimates and market assumptions for inputs like prepayment speeds and discount rates. This contrasts with the amortized cost method, which is more conservative and results in a smoother, more predictable earnings contribution from MSRs. The change resulted in a $3.4 million increase to retained earnings upon adoption (2021 10-K, Note 1, p. 82 and 84).\n\n### **5. Are there any changes in the summary of significant accounting policies?**\nYes. The company changed its accounting method for Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs). Effective January 1, 2021, the company adopted the fair value method to measure its MSRs. Previously, the company had used the amortized cost method (2021 10-K, Note 1, p. 82).\n\n### **6. Are there any changes to the Risk section? What was the header of the new or removed section?**\nYes. The risk factors in the 2021 10-K are substantially different from those in the 2020 10-K because the 2020 report was for Gores Holdings IV, Inc., a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC), which had just completed its business combination with UWM. The 2021 10-K reflects the risks of the operating mortgage business.\n\nNotable new risks disclosed in the 2021 report that were not present in the 2020 report include risks related to the company's \"All-In\" policy, which requires its partner brokers not to work with certain competitors. This policy has led to litigation and could adversely affect the company's reputation and ability to attract new brokers (2021 10-K, Item 1A, p. 24).\n\n### **7. What are the notable items in the commitments and contingencies section?**\nYes. The company is involved in several notable legal proceedings, including:\n*   A class action lawsuit filed by independent mortgage brokers alleging anticompetitive conduct under federal and Florida antitrust laws related to the company's \"All-In\" policy, which restricts brokers from working with certain competitors. The plaintiffs are seeking treble damages, attorneys' fees, and injunctive relief (2021 10-K, Item 3, p. 48).\n*   A class action lawsuit filed by a former employee alleging violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act for unpaid overtime wages (2021 10-K, Item 3, p. 49).\n\n### **8. Does the company rely heavily on adjusted measures in the filings?**\nYes. The company uses the non-GAAP measure \"Adjusted EBITDA\" to evaluate its operating performance. The reconciliation from Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA includes numerous adjustments, notably removing the \"change in fair value of MSRs due to valuation inputs or assumptions.\" This specific adjustment removes a significant and volatile non-cash item from earnings, which presents a smoother performance metric to investors than GAAP net income (2021 10-K, Item 7, p. 54-55).\n\n### **9. Are there consistent uses of one-time charges?**\nNo.\n\n### **10. Were there any changes in reported business segments? If so, what was management's justification for the change?**\nNo.\n\n### **11. Did the company cease reporting or introduce any key metrics in the MD&A? If so, what was management's justification for the change?**\nNo.\n\n### **12. Are there any contracts that can be valued aggressively? Were these contracts valued internally, by the market, or by a third party? Does the company make public and clear what the variables and their values are in the report?**\nYes. Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) and Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs) are valued using significant unobservable (Level 3) inputs that can be manipulated.\n\n*   **Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs):** The company states that the fair value of MSRs is determined with the assistance of a third-party broker based on a valuation model. However, the model relies on significant Level 3 inputs estimated by management, such as prepayment speeds and discount rates. The report clearly discloses the ranges and weighted averages for these key inputs and provides a sensitivity analysis showing how changes in these assumptions would impact the MSR fair value (2021 10-K, Note 5, p. 90-92).\n*   **Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs):** The fair value of IRLCs is also a Level 3 measurement because it relies on an internally estimated \"pull-through rate\" (the probability that the loan commitment will be exercised). The company discloses the weighted average pull-through rate used in its calculation (2021 10-K, Note 3, p. 89).\n\nWhile the company uses a third party for MSR valuation, the reliance on significant internal estimates for both MSRs and IRLCs presents an opportunity for aggressive valuation. The company does provide clear disclosure of the key variables and their values.\n\n### **13. Summarize any related party transactions.**\nThe company engages in extensive and material related party transactions, primarily with entities controlled by its CEO, Mat Ishbia, and its founder, Jeffrey A. Ishbia. Notable transactions include:\n*   **Property Leases:** The company leases its corporate campus buildings and land from entities controlled by the Ishbia family. Lease payments to these related parties totaled $11.6 million in 2021 (2021 10-K, Note 7 and Note 17).\n*   **Aircraft Leases:** The company leases two aircraft from entities controlled by the CEO for executive travel (2021 10-K, Note 17).\n*   **Legal Services:** The company pays legal fees to a law firm where the founder, Jeffrey A. Ishbia, is a partner. These fees were $0.6 million in 2021 (2021 10-K, Note 17).\n*   **Appraisal Services:** The company paid for services from home appraisal management companies partially owned by the CEO (interest disposed of March 31, 2021) and his brother (2021 10-K, Note 17).\n\n### **14. Were there any notable changes in tone of the MD&A. Focus on accusatory language or an increased use of jargon.**\nNo.\n\n### **15. Does the company have a unconventional corporate structure?**\nYes. The company has a complex \"Up-C\" corporate structure, which is unconventional for public companies. Key features include:\n*   The public company (UWM Holdings Corporation) holds a minority economic interest in the operating subsidiary (Holdings LLC), with the majority economic interest retained by the pre-IPO owner, SFS Corp. (an entity controlled by the Ishbia family).\n*   A multi-class stock structure with super-voting Class D shares held by SFS Corp., which gives it approximately 79% of the total voting power while holding approximately 94% of the economic interest. This allows the founding family to maintain control over the public company.\n*   A Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA) that requires the public company to pay 85% of certain tax savings it realizes to SFS Corp. This agreement facilitates a significant transfer of value from the public company to the founding family.\n(2021 10-K, Note 1, p. 82 and Item 1A, p. 31-33).\n\n### **16. Based on your answers are any red flags? If so, provide a breakdown of why.**\nYes, there are several red flags related to corporate governance, related party transactions, and accounting policies.\n\n*   **Corporate Governance and Related Party Transactions (High Risk):** The combination of the Up-C structure, super-voting stock, and extensive related party transactions represents a significant red flag. This structure concentrates control with the founding family and creates potential conflicts of interest. The company leases its primary real estate and aircraft from entities owned by its CEO and founder, allowing for the potential extraction of value from the public company at terms that may not be at arm's length. This raises concerns that management may not be acting in the best interests of all shareholders.\n*   **Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA) (High Risk):** The TRA is a mechanism to transfer significant economic value directly from the public company to the pre-IPO owners (the Ishbia family's SFS Corp.). It requires the company to pay out 85% of its tax savings from the Up-C structure, which represents a substantial and long-term cash obligation that benefits the controlling shareholder at the expense of public shareholders.\n*   **Aggressive Accounting Change (Medium Risk):** The switch to fair value accounting for MSRs makes earnings more volatile and susceptible to management's subjective assumptions. While permitted and disclosed, this move away from the more conservative amortized cost method can be used to manage earnings. The fact that the company removes the volatility from this estimate in its non-GAAP \"Adjusted EBITDA\" metric suggests a desire to present a smoother earnings profile than what GAAP requires.\n*   **Antitrust Litigation (Medium Risk):** The company's core \"All-In\" business strategy is being challenged in court as anticompetitive. An adverse outcome could force a change in this key strategy and result in significant financial damages, posing a material risk to the business model.\n\n### **17. If there are any red flags, what are your recommended next steps to further investigate the issues?**\n1.  **Investigate Related Party Leases:** Conduct a detailed market analysis to determine if the lease rates paid by the company for its corporate campus and aircraft are at, above, or below fair market value. This would require comparing the terms in the lease agreements (filed as exhibits) to market data for similar commercial properties in Pontiac, Michigan, and for similar private aircraft. This will help quantify if value is being improperly extracted.\n2.  **Model the Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA):** Analyze the TRA (filed as an exhibit) and build a financial model to project the potential future cash payments from the company to SFS Corp. This model should incorporate assumptions about the company's future profitability, tax rates, and the schedule of unit exchanges by SFS Corp. to estimate the magnitude of this liability.\n3.  **Peer Analysis of MSR Valuation:** Compare UWM's MSR valuation assumptions (prepayment speeds, discount rates) against those disclosed by publicly traded peers in the mortgage origination industry (e.g., Rocket Companies, loanDepot). This will help determine if UWM's assumptions are overly optimistic or aggressive relative to the industry standard.\n4.  **Monitor Legal Proceedings:** Closely follow all court filings, judicial rulings, and legal commentary related to the antitrust lawsuit concerning the \"All-In\" policy. This is critical for assessing the legal and financial risk to the company's business model.", "20211231 10-K vs 20221231 10-K": "**1. What are the 2 reports being compared?

List the auditor.**\nDeloitte & Touche LLP (2022 10-K, p. 68; 2021 10-K, p. 73) and Richey, May & Co., LLP (2021 10-K, p. 77 for the year ended December 31, 2019).\n\n**3. Are there any disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures?**\nNo.\n\n**4. Are any of the policies in the summary of significant accounting policies seen as aggressive for a company in its industry?**\nNo.\n\n**5. Are there any changes in the summary of significant accounting policies?**\nYes. In 2022, the company changed its balance sheet presentation for Ginnie Mae loans eligible for repurchase. Previously, these were included within \"Mortgage loans at fair value\" and \"Accounts payable, accrued expenses, and other.\" They are now reported as separate line items on the consolidated balance sheets, and prior periods were updated to conform to this presentation (2022 10-K, Note 1: Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, p. 78). The company also noted a change in how it accounts for subsequent changes in estimates for its representations and warranties reserve. The initial provision is included in \"loan production income,\" while subsequent changes in estimates are recorded as part of \"general and administrative\" expenses (2022 10-K, Note 1: Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, p. 78).\n\n**6. Are there any changes to the Risk section? What was the header of the new or removed section?**\nNo.\n\n**7. What are the notable items in the commitments and contingencies section?**\nYes.\n*   **Representations and Warranties:** The company repurchased $355.8 million in unpaid principal balance (UPB) of loans during the year ended December 31, 2022, a significant increase from $133.4 million in 2021. The reserve for these obligations decreased from $86.8 million at year-end 2021 to $60.5 million at year-end 2022 (2022 10-K, Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies, p. 89-90).\n*   **Legal Proceedings:** The company is involved in an antitrust lawsuit filed by The Okavage Group, LLC, alleging that UWM's \"All-In\" policy (prohibiting brokers who work with UWM from also working with two specific competitors) amounts to anticompetitive conduct. The case remains pending (2022 10-K, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, p. 43).\n*   **Commitments to Originate Loans:** The company's commitments to extend credit to potential borrowers decreased significantly, from $28.9 billion as of December 31, 2021, to $14.1 billion as of December 31, 2022 (2022 10-K, Note 10: Commitments and Contingencies, p. 90).\n\n**8. Does the company rely heavily on adjusted measures in the filings?**\nYes. The company uses Adjusted EBITDA throughout its Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). This non-GAAP measure excludes significant items such as interest expense on non-funding debt, provision for income taxes, depreciation and amortization, stock-based compensation expense, and the change in fair value of Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) due to valuation inputs or assumptions (2022 10-K, Item 7. MD&A, p. 47-48; 2021 10-K, Item 7. MD&A, p. 54-55).\n\n**9. Are there consistent uses of one-time charges?**\nNo.\n\n**10. Were there any changes in reported business segments? If so, what was management's justification for the change?**\nNo.\n\n**11. Did the company cease reporting or introduce any key metrics in the MD&A? If so, what was management's justification for the change?**\nYes. The 2022 10-K MD&A introduces a detailed table breaking down loan origination volume by \"Purchase\" and \"Refinance\" categories. While the 2021 report discussed the mix, it did not provide this level of tabular detail. Additionally, the 2022 report introduces \"Gain margin\" as a key metric in the loan production income table, defining it as total loan production income divided by total loan origination volume. No explicit justification for the changes was provided, but the enhanced disclosure aligns with the significant market shift from a refinance-heavy environment in 2021 to a purchase-heavy one in 2022 (2022 10-K, Item 7. MD&A, p. 50).\n\n**12. Are there any contracts that can be valued aggressively? Were these contracts valued internally, by the market, or by a third party? Does the company make public and clear what the variables and their values are in the report?**\nYes. The company's Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) and Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs) are valued using Level 3 inputs, which are unobservable and require significant judgment.\n*   **MSRs:** The fair value of MSRs is determined with the assistance of a third-party expert using a valuation model. This model relies on significant unobservable inputs, including prepayment speeds, discount rate, and cost to service. The company discloses the weighted average and range for these key assumptions and provides a sensitivity analysis showing the hypothetical effect of adverse changes. (2022 10-K, Note 5: Mortgage Servicing Rights, p. 83-84; 2021 10-K, Note 5: Mortgage Servicing Rights, p. 90-91).\n*   **IRLCs:** These are valued based on market prices for similar loans but are also subject to an estimated \"pull-through rate,\" which is the probability that the commitment will be exercised. This pull-through rate is a significant, unobservable Level 3 input based on historical experience. The company discloses the weighted average pull-through rate used in its valuation (2022 10-K, Note 3: Derivatives, p. 82; 2021 10-K, Note 3: Derivatives, p. 89).\n\n**13. Summarize any related party transactions.**\nThe company engages in several significant related-party transactions with entities controlled by its CEO, Mat Ishbia, and its founder, Jeffrey Ishbia.\n*   **Leases:** The company's corporate campus is leased from entities controlled by the CEO and founder. Lease payments to these related parties were $24.9 million in 2022 and $19.4 million in 2021 (2022 10-K, Note 16: Related Party Transactions, p. 94; 2021 10-K, Note 17: Related Party Transactions, p. 100).\n*   **Legal Services:** Legal services are provided by a law firm where the company's founder is a partner, with payments of $0.6 million in both 2022 and 2021 (2022 10-K, Note 16: Related Party Transactions, p. 94; 2021 10-K, Note 17: Related Party Transactions, p. 100).\n*   **Aircraft Leases:** The company leases aircraft owned by entities controlled by the CEO (2022 10-K, Note 16: Related Party Transactions, p. 94; 2021 10-K, Note 17: Related Party Transactions, p. 100).\n*   **Revolving Credit Facility:** In August 2022, UWM entered into a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with SFS Holding Corp. (the controlling shareholder) as the lender. No amounts were outstanding as of December 31, 2022 (2022 10-K, Note 9: Other Borrowings, p. 89).\n*   **Appraisal Services:** The company uses an appraisal management company owned by the CEO's brother, who is also a director on the company's board (2022 10-K, Note 16: Related Party Transactions, p. 94).\n\n**14. Were there any notable changes in tone of the MD&A. Focus on accusatory language or an increased use of jargon.**\nYes. The tone of the MD&A in the 2022 10-K is notably more defensive and focused on strategic justifications for declining performance compared to the 2021 10-K. The 2022 report repeatedly mentions a \"pricing initiative launched by UWM in the second half of 2022 aimed at long-term growth of the wholesale channel and our market share.\" It frames this strategy as a success, citing that the company became \"the largest residential mortgage lender in the country for the second half of 2022\" as a direct result. This language serves to justify the significant decrease in gain margin during a period of rising interest rates and intense competition (2022 10-K, Item 7. MD&A, p. 51).\n\n**15. Does the company have a unconventional corporate structure?**\nYes. The company has an \"Up-C\" corporate structure. The public company (UWM Holdings Corporation) holds a minority economic interest (approximately 6%) in the operating subsidiary (Holdings LLC), but is the sole managing member. The vast majority of the economic interest (approximately 94%) is held by a private entity, SFS Holding Corp. (\"SFS Corp.\"), which is controlled by the founder and CEO's family. SFS Corp. also holds all of the Class D common stock, which carries 10 votes per share, giving it approximately 79% of the total voting power and effective control over the company. This structure allows the original owners to maintain control while accessing public markets. The company is also designated as a \"controlled company\" under NYSE rules, exempting it from certain corporate governance requirements, such as having a majority-independent board of directors (2022 10-K, Note 1: Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies, p. 75 and Risk Factors, p. 39).\n\n**16. Based on your answers are any red flags? If so, provide a breakdown of why.**\nYes.\n*   **Corporate Governance and Control:** The \"Up-C\" structure combined with dual-class super-voting stock consolidates power with the founding family (via SFS Corp.), potentially misaligning their interests with those of public Class A shareholders. The company's status as a \"controlled company\" further weakens independent oversight by exempting it from requirements for a majority-independent board and independent nominating and compensation committees.\n*   **Extensive Related-Party Transactions:** The company has numerous and significant financial dealings with entities owned by its CEO and founder, including leases for its corporate headquarters, legal services, aircraft usage, and a new $500 million credit facility. This creates significant potential for conflicts of interest and raises questions as to whether these transactions are conducted at arm's-length terms that are in the best interest of all shareholders.\n*   **Aggressive Valuation and Accounting Policies:** The company relies heavily on Level 3 fair value estimates for its material MSR and IRLC assets. These valuations depend on subjective, unobservable inputs like prepayment speeds and pull-through rates, which can be manipulated to manage earnings. The significant increase in the fair value of MSRs due to valuation inputs ($868.8 million in 2022) was a primary driver of net income in a year where core origination profitability declined sharply, highlighting the impact of these subjective estimates.\n*   **Aggressive Business Practices and Legal Risk:** The \"All-In\" policy, which restricts brokers from working with key competitors, has led to an ongoing antitrust lawsuit. This policy, while potentially beneficial for market share, indicates an aggressive competitive stance that carries significant legal, financial, and reputational risk.\n*   **Sharp Decline in Core Profitability:** While overall net income was positive, loan production income fell 62% from $2.6 billion in 2021 to $982 million in 2022. The gain margin was nearly halved, falling from 1.14% to 0.77%. Management attributes this to a strategic \"pricing initiative,\" but it signals a severe compression in the profitability of its core business.\n\n**17. If there are any red flags, what are your recommended next steps to further investigate the issues?**\n*   **Scrutinize Related-Party Transactions:** Benchmark the terms of the related-party leases, legal services, and the new credit facility against market rates for similar arrangements to assess their fairness. Review proxy statements for disclosures on how these transactions were approved by the board and whether independent directors were involved in the review process.\n*   **Analyze Fair Value Assumptions:** Compare UWM's disclosed MSR and IRLC valuation assumptions (e.g., prepayment speeds, discount rates, pull-through rates) against those of publicly traded peers in the mortgage origination and servicing industry. Significant deviations could indicate aggressive or overly optimistic estimates.\n*   **Monitor Legal Proceedings:** Closely follow all filings and developments in the antitrust lawsuit related to the \"All-In\" policy. Assess management's commentary on the litigation and any changes to the reserve for legal contingencies.\n*   **Assess \"Pricing Initiative\" Sustainability:** Analyze quarterly trends in gain-on-sale margin and loan volume to determine if the aggressive pricing strategy is leading to sustainable market share growth or simply eroding profitability. Compare UWM's margins to competitors' to understand if the compression is industry-wide or company-specific.\n*   **Focus on Cash Flow:** De-emphasize Adjusted EBITDA and focus on the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Compare Net Cash from Operating Activities to reported Net Income to understand the impact of non-cash fair value adjustments and determine the company's true cash-generating ability from its operations.", "20221231 10-K vs 20231231 10-K": "### **1.

Are any of the policies in the summary of significant accounting policies seen as aggressive for a company in its industry?**\nNo.\n\n### **5. Are any changes in the summary of significant accounting policies?**\nYes. In the 2023 10-K, a new disclosure was added under \"Note 1 – Organization, Basis of Presentation and Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\" to describe the accounting for \"Excess Servicing Cash Flow Transactions.\" This new activity, which the company began in 2023, involves separating and selling the rights to servicing fees that exceed the base servicing fee required by Government-Sponsored Enterprises (GSEs). This addition reflects a new type of transaction for the company rather than a change in an existing policy.\n\n### **6. Are there any changes to the Risk section? What was the header of the new or removed section?**\nYes. The 2023 10-K added a new, required section under \"Item 1C. Cybersecurity.\" Additionally, within the \"Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements\" and \"Risk Factor Summary\" sections, the 2023 10-K added or expanded upon several risks, reflecting the current business environment. Notable additions include:\n*   The impact of inflation on housing prices and borrower affordability.\n*   Changes in banking regulations that may impact warehouse financing availability.\n*   Risks related to hedging strategies proving ineffective or causing margin calls.\n*   Cybersecurity failures at third-party vendors, specifically calling out sub-servicers (2023 10-K, pp. 2-3).\n\n### **7. What are the notable items in the commitments and contingencies section?**\nThe Representations and Warranties reserve remained relatively stable at $62.9 million in 2023 compared to $60.5 million in 2022. However, the unpaid principal balance (UPB) of loans the company actually repurchased decreased by 27% from $355.8 million in 2022 to $259.0 million in 2023.\n\nDespite a 15% decrease in total loan origination volume year-over-year, the notional amount of Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs) increased by 17%, from $5.4 billion at year-end 2022 to $6.3 billion at year-end 2023 (2023 10-K, Note 10; 2022 10-K, Note 10).\n\n### **8. Does the company rely heavily on adjusted measures in the filings?**\nYes. In the Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) section of both reports, the company presents \"Adjusted EBITDA\" as a non-GAAP measure to evaluate its operating performance. Management uses this measure for planning and forecasting and believes it is useful for investors. The reports provide a detailed reconciliation from the most comparable GAAP measure, Net Income (Loss) (2023 10-K, p. 42; 2022 10-K, p. 48).\n\n### **9. Are there consistent uses of one-time charges?**\nNo.\n\n### **10. Were there any changes in reported business segments? If so, what was management's justification for the change?**\nNo.\n\n### **11. Did the company cease reporting or introduce any key metrics in the MD&A? If so, what was management's justification for the change?**\nNo.\n\n### **12. Are there any contracts that can be valued aggressively? Were these contracts valued internally, by the market, or by a third party? Does the company make public and clear what the variables and their values are in the report?**\nYes. Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) and Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs) are significant assets and liabilities whose valuations rely on unobservable (Level 3) inputs, which can be subjective.\n\n*   **Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs):** These represent a significant asset ($4.0 billion as of December 31, 2023). The fair value is determined with the assistance of a third-party valuation expert using a model that calculates the present value of future cash flows. The company clearly discloses the key unobservable inputs (discount rates, prepayment speeds, cost of servicing) by providing a range and a weighted average. It also provides a sensitivity analysis showing how a 10% or 20% adverse change in these inputs would impact the fair value (2023 10-K, Note 5).\n\n*   **Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs):** These are derivative instruments valued using models that incorporate an estimated \"pull-through rate\" (the probability that the loan will actually close). This rate is a significant unobservable (Level 3) input based on historical experience. The company discloses the blended average pull-through rate in its disclosures (2023 10-K, Note 3).\n\nWhile the use of a third party for MSR valuation is a good practice, the assumptions are inherently subjective and can be viewed as aggressive depending on market conditions. The company's disclosures regarding the variables and their sensitivity are transparent.\n\n### **13. Summarize any related party transactions.**\nThe company engages in several significant and recurring transactions with entities owned or controlled by its CEO, Mat Ishbia, and/or its founder and director, Jeffrey Ishbia. These include:\n*   **Property Leases:** The company leases its corporate headquarters and other properties from entities controlled by the Ishbias. Rent and occupancy-related payments to these entities totaled approximately $20.0 million in 2023 and $24.9 million in 2022.\n*   **Aircraft Leases:** The company leases aircraft owned by entities controlled by the CEO for business travel.\n*   **Revolving Credit Facility:** The company's subsidiary, UWM, has a $500.0 million unsecured revolving credit facility with SFS Holding Corp. (the company's controlling shareholder) as the lender. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at the end of 2023 or 2022.\n*   **Legal Services:** The company obtains legal services from a firm where the founder is a partner.\n(2023 10-K, Note 17; 2022 10-K, Note 16)\n\n### **14. Were there any notable changes in tone of the MD&A. Focus on accusatory language or an increased use of jargon.**\nNo.\n\n### **15. Does the company have a unconventional corporate structure?**\nYes. The company has an \"Up-C\" corporate structure, which is unconventional for a public company.\n*   The public entity, UWM Holdings Corporation (UWMC), holds only a minority economic interest (approx. 5.9% as of year-end 2023) in the operating subsidiary, UWM Holdings, LLC.\n*   The majority economic interest (approx. 94.1%) is held by SFS Holding Corp., the pre-IPO owner controlled by the Ishbia family. This is reflected as a large non-controlling interest on the balance sheet.\n*   SFS Holding Corp. controls approximately 79% of the total voting power through its ownership of Class D common stock, which has 10 votes per share, giving it super-voting rights and effective control over the company.\n*   The structure includes a Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA), which contractually obligates the public company to pay 85% of certain tax savings it realizes to SFS Holding Corp.\n(2023 10-K, Note 1)\n\n### **16. Based on your answers are any red flags? If so, provide a breakdown of why.**\nYes, several red flags are present:\n\n*   **Overwhelming Insider Control and Unconventional Corporate Structure:** The Up-C structure and super-voting shares give the pre-IPO owner, SFS Corp. (controlled by the Ishbia family), nearly complete control over the company without holding a commensurate economic interest. This creates a potential misalignment between the interests of the controlling shareholder and public Class A shareholders. The controlling shareholder can approve major corporate actions, elect the entire board, and make decisions that may benefit them at the expense of public shareholders.\n\n*   **Significant and Recurring Related-Party Transactions:** The company spends tens of millions of dollars annually on leases for its headquarters with entities owned by its CEO and founder. It also has a $500 million credit line with its controlling shareholder. While disclosed, these transactions are not subject to arms-length negotiation and create significant conflicts of interest. It raises questions about whether the terms are favorable to the public company and its shareholders.\n\n*   **Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA):** This agreement is a significant red flag as it institutionalizes a mechanism to transfer wealth from the public company to its pre-IPO owner. It requires UWMC to pay 85% of certain tax benefits directly to SFS Corp. This cash could otherwise be reinvested in the business, used to pay down debt, or be distributed to all shareholders via dividends.\n\n*   **Large Balance of Subjectively Valued Assets:** Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) are a $4.0 billion asset whose value is based on complex models with subjective, unobservable inputs (Level 3). While the company provides good disclosure and uses a third-party expert, the sheer size of this asset makes the company's earnings and book value highly sensitive to slight changes in management's assumptions about interest rates and prepayment speeds. This subjectivity can be used to manage earnings.\n\n### **17. If there are any red flags, what are your recommended next steps to further investigate the issues?**\n*   **Analyze Related-Party Leases:** Conduct a real estate market analysis to compare the per-square-foot lease rates the company pays to related parties against market rates for similar commercial properties in the Pontiac, Michigan area. This would help determine if the lease terms are at, above, or below market rates.\n\n*   **Scrutinize Cash Distributions:** Perform a detailed analysis of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows and Changes in Equity, focusing on all distributions made to the non-controlling interest (SFS Corp.). This includes regular profit distributions, special distributions, and required tax distributions, to quantify the total cash flowing from the operating entity to the controlling shareholder.\n\n*   **Benchmark MSR Valuation Assumptions:** Compare the key unobservable inputs used for MSR valuation (disclosed in Note 5) against those disclosed by publicly traded peers in the mortgage origination and servicing industry (e.g., Rocket Companies, PennyMac Financial Services). Significant deviations in prepayment speed or discount rate assumptions could indicate aggressive or conservative valuation.\n\n*   **Monitor Litigation:** Closely follow the developments in the antitrust litigation regarding the company's \"All-In\" policy (Okavage lawsuit). An adverse outcome could result in significant financial damages and require changes to a key competitive business practice.", "20231231 10-K vs 20241231 10-K": "1.     What are the 2 reports being compared? Reply in the following format: {Company Name}, {report type (10-K, 10-Q, etc.) of report 1} Period End Date: {period end date of report 1} and {report type (10-K, 10-Q, etc.) of report 2} Period End Date: {period end date of report 2}.\nUWM HOLDINGS CORPORATION, 10-K Period End Date: 2023-12-31 and 10-K Period End Date: 2024-12-31.\n\n2.     List the auditor.\nDeloitte & Touche LLP (2023 10-K, p. 61; 2024 10-K, p. 59).\n\n3.     Are there any disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosures?\nNo.\n\n4.     Are there any changes in the summary of significant accounting policies?\nYes. The 2024 10-K provides more detailed disclosures and clarifications on several policies compared to the 2023 10-K, reflecting changes in the company's activities and structure during the year.\n\n*   **Loan Production Income:** The description of \"primary gain (loss)\" is significantly expanded to detail its components, including the difference between the sale price and purchase price of loans and the change in fair value of derivatives like IRLCs and FLSCs (2024 10-K, Note 1).\n*   **Derivatives:** The 2024 report introduces a policy for \"other interest rate derivatives,\" specifically mentioning their use for MSR risk mitigation and reporting changes in their value under a new income statement line item, \"Loss on other interest rate derivatives\" (2024 10-K, Note 1).\n*   **Income Taxes & Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA):** The 2024 report adds new language clarifying that when SFS Corp. exchanges its units in the operating company for public company shares (an \"Exchange Transaction\"), the related income tax effects and the corresponding adjustment to the TRA liability are recorded as adjustments to equity (2024 10-K, Note 1). This reflects the Exchange Transactions that occurred in 2024.\n\n5.     Are any of the policies in the summary of significant accounting policies seen as aggressive for a company in its industry?\nThe company's accounting policies are generally within the norms for the mortgage industry, but two areas allow for significant management judgment which could be applied aggressively:\n\n*   **Fair Value of Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs):** The company elects to measure its MSRs at fair value. MSRs are classified as Level 3 assets because their valuation relies on significant unobservable inputs, such as prepayment speeds and discount rates. This subjectivity creates the potential for management to influence reported earnings through its assumptions. The income statement shows high volatility from this account, with a change in fair value of MSRs contributing to a $284 million gain in 2022, an $854 million loss in 2023, and a $295 million loss in 2024 (2024 10-K, Consolidated Statements of Operations).\n*   **Revenue Recognition:** The company notes that it recognizes a majority of its origination revenue when a loan is originated and recorded at fair value. It also explicitly states, \"Other companies recognize a majority of the revenue related to lending activity when they make an interest rate lock commitment with a borrower\" (2024 10-K, Note 1). While recognizing revenue at origination is a valid method, the choice of a different primary recognition event than some peers highlights a key area of judgment that can affect the timing of revenue.\n\n6.     Are there any changes to the Risk section? What was the header of the new or removed section?\nYes. The 2024 10-K introduces a new risk factor related to Artificial Intelligence.\n\n*   **New Section Header:** \"The development, proliferation and use of AI could give rise to legal and/or regulatory action, damage our reputation or otherwise materially harm our business.\" (2024 10-K, Item 1A. Risk Factors, p. 17).\n\nAdditionally, several existing risk factor headers were rephrased or expanded to provide more specific detail, such as separating risks related to MSR valuation from general interest rate risks.\n\n7.     What are the notable items in the commitments and contingencies section?\nYes, there are two notable items:\n\n*   **New Litigation:** The 2024 10-K discloses a new class action complaint filed against the company on April 2, 2024 (*Therisa D. Escue, et al.*). The lawsuit alleges that UWM improperly influenced mortgage brokers to steer borrowers to UWM at inflated prices and fees. This new litigation presents a significant legal and reputational risk as it targets the core of the company's business model (2024 10-K, Item 3. Legal Proceedings, p. 37).\n*   **Representations and Warranties Reserve:** The reserve for potential loan repurchases and indemnification losses increased by 39% from $62.9 million at year-end 2023 to $87.6 million at year-end 2024. This increase occurred despite a 9.5% decrease in the unpaid principal balance of loans the company actually repurchased during the year ($234.4 million in 2024 vs. $259.0 million in 2023). This may suggest that management anticipates a higher rate of future losses on loans it has sold (2024 10-K, Note 10).\n\n8.     Does the company rely heavily on adjusted measures in the filings?\nYes. The company heavily features the non-GAAP measure \"Adjusted EBITDA\" in its Management's Discussion and Analysis (MD&A). It is presented alongside GAAP Net Income (Loss) in the summary of results and is used to \"evaluate our operating performance\" (2024 10-K, Item 7. MD&A, p. 40). Notably, the reconciliation from Net Income to Adjusted EBITDA for 2024 includes a significant new adjustment of $215.4 million for \"Loss on other interest rate derivatives,\" which was not present in prior years.\n\n9.     Are there consistent uses of one-time charges?\nNo. The company does not explicitly label any expenses as \"one-time,\" \"special,\" or \"non-recurring\" charges. However, it consistently makes numerous adjustments to its GAAP Net Income to calculate its preferred non-GAAP metric, \"Adjusted EBITDA.\" These adjustments remove the impact of items like changes in the fair value of MSRs, warrants, and, newly in 2024, losses on certain derivatives, effectively treating them as non-core operational items.\n\n10.    Were there any changes in reported business segments? If so, what was management's justification for the change?\nNo.\n\n11.    Did the company cease reporting or introduce any key metrics in the MD&A? If so, what was management's justification for the change?\nNo.\n\n12.    Are there any contracts that can be valued aggressively? Were these contracts valued internally, by the market, or by a third party? Does the company make public and clear what the variables and their values are in the report?\nYes. The company's Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs) and Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs) are both classified as Level 3 assets, meaning their valuations are based on significant unobservable inputs and are subject to management judgment, which could be applied aggressively.\n\n*   **Mortgage Servicing Rights (MSRs):** These assets, valued at approximately $4.0 billion, are valued \"with the assistance of a third party broker\" using a valuation model (2024 10-K, Note 5). While a third party is involved, the models depend on subjective assumptions. The company discloses the key unobservable inputs (range and weighted average for discount rates, prepayment speeds, and cost of servicing) and provides a sensitivity analysis showing how changes in these inputs would affect the MSR value.\n*   **Interest Rate Lock Commitments (IRLCs):** These derivatives are valued based on market prices for similar loans but are also subject to an internally developed, unobservable \"pullthrough rate\" assumption, which estimates the probability that the commitment will result in a closed loan. The company discloses the weighted average pullthrough rate (2024 10-K, Note 16).\n\nIn summary, while the company uses a third party for its largest Level 3 asset and provides disclosures on key assumptions, the inherent nature of these assets allows for significant judgment that could be used to manage earnings.\n\n13.    Summarize any related party transactions.\nThe company engages in several significant and recurring related-party transactions, primarily with its CEO, Mat Ishbia, its founder and director, Jeffrey Ishbia, and its controlling shareholder, SFS Corp. (controlled by the Ishbia family).\n\n*   **Property Leases:** The company's corporate headquarters and primary operating facilities are leased from entities controlled by the CEO and founder. Net payments for rent and occupancy were $19.5 million in 2024 and $20.0 million in 2023 (2024 10-K, Note 17).\n*   **Revolving Credit Facility:** UWM has a $500 million unsecured revolving line of credit from its controlling shareholder, SFS Corp. No amounts were outstanding under this facility at the end of 2024 or 2023 (2024 10-K, Note 9).\n*   **Legal Services:** The company pays for legal services from a law firm where the founder is a partner, amounting to $0.6 million in both 2024 and 2023 (2024 10-K, Note 17).\n*   **Aircraft Leases:** The company leases aircraft from entities controlled by the CEO for business travel (2024 10-K, Note 17).\n*   **Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA):** The company is obligated to pay its pre-IPO owner, SFS Corp., 85% of the tax savings it realizes from the \"Up-C\" structure. The liability for this agreement increased from $15.5 million in 2023 to $78.5 million in 2024 following share exchanges by SFS Corp. (2024 10-K, Note 18).\n\n14.    Were there any notable changes in tone of the MD&A. Focus on accusatory language or an increased use of jargon.\nNo. The tone of the MD&A remains consistent between the two reports. It is professional and descriptive of the business operations and financial results. There is no notable increase in jargon or use of accusatory language.\n\n15.    Does the company have a unconventional corporate structure?\nYes. The company has a complex \"Up-C\" corporate structure.\n\n*   **Control Structure:** The public entity, UWM Holdings Corporation, holds only a minority economic interest in the main operating business, Holdings LLC (9.88% at year-end 2024). The vast majority of the economic interest is held by the pre-IPO owner, SFS Corp., and is reported as a \"non-controlling interest\" on the balance sheet.\n*   **Voting Power:** Despite its minority economic stake, SFS Corp. maintains majority voting control (approximately 79%) through its ownership of super-voting Class D common stock, which carries 10 votes per share.\n*   **Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA):** The structure includes a TRA that directs 85% of certain tax savings realized by the public company back to SFS Corp. This is a significant cash obligation that primarily benefits the controlling shareholder, not all shareholders equally.\n\nThis structure is unconventional for most public companies and is designed to provide tax benefits to the pre-IPO owners while consolidating their voting control.\n\n16.    Based on your answers are any red flags? If so, provide a breakdown of why.\nYes, the following red flags are present:\n\n*   **Complex Corporate Structure & Concentrated Control:** The \"Up-C\" structure and dual-class shares consolidate nearly all voting control with the Ishbia family (via SFS Corp.), while public shareholders have a minority economic stake with limited voting power. This creates a significant potential for conflicts of interest, where decisions may prioritize the controlling shareholder over public shareholders. The Tax Receivable Agreement is a direct manifestation of this, obligating the public company to make substantial future payments to the controlling shareholder.\n*   **Extensive Related-Party Transactions:** The company's reliance on its CEO and founder for its primary operating facilities is a major red flag. This arrangement means a significant operating expense (rent) is not determined through an arm's-length negotiation, creating an opportunity to extract value from the public company for the benefit of insiders. The $500 million credit line from the controlling shareholder further blurs the lines between the company and its majority owner.\n*   **Significant Subjectivity in Asset Valuation:** A large portion of the company's balance sheet consists of Level 3 assets (MSRs), valued at nearly $4.0 billion. The value of these assets is highly sensitive to management's subjective assumptions about interest rates and prepayment speeds. This subjectivity can lead to significant non-cash gains or losses that impact reported earnings, as seen in the large swings in fair value changes from 2022 to 2024. This gives management a powerful tool to manage earnings.\n*   **New, Material Litigation:** The 2024 class-action lawsuit alleging a scheme to steer borrowers into overpriced loans strikes at the heart of UWM's business model and its relationship with its broker network. An adverse outcome could have a material financial and reputational impact and could force changes to its core operations.\n\n17.    If there are any red flags, what are your recommended next steps to further investigate the issues?\nTo further investigate the identified red flags, the following steps are recommended:\n\n*   **Analyze Related-Party Leases:** Obtain commercial real estate market data for comparable properties in the Pontiac, Michigan area. Compare the company's reported rent expense per square foot, lease terms, and annual escalations to market rates to determine if the lease agreements are on arm's-length terms or if they appear to favor the related-party landlords.\n*   **Model the Tax Receivable Agreement (TRA):** Scrutinize the disclosures related to the TRA. Build a model to project future potential payments to SFS Corp. based on different scenarios for future taxable income, tax rates, and the timing of further share exchanges by SFS Corp. This helps quantify the magnitude of this off-balance-sheet-like liability.\n*   **Benchmark MSR Valuation Assumptions:** Compare UWM's disclosed unobservable inputs for MSR valuation (discount rates, prepayment speeds) against those disclosed by publicly-traded peers in the mortgage industry (e.g., Mr. Cooper Group, PennyMac Financial Services) for the same reporting periods. Material deviations from industry norms could indicate aggressive or conservative accounting assumptions and warrant further questioning.\n*   **Monitor Litigation and Regulatory Filings:** Closely track all court filings, motions, and judicial decisions in the *Escue, et al.* class-action lawsuit. Additionally, monitor for any related inquiries or investigations from regulatory bodies like the CFPB or state attorneys general, as such litigation can often trigger regulatory scrutiny.\n*   **Track Insider Transactions:** Review all Form 4 filings to track sales of stock by insiders, particularly following the \"Exchange Transactions\" where SFS Corp. converts its operating units into public shares. The timing, volume, and price of these sales can provide insight into the insiders' perspective on the company's valuation and future prospects."}
