<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">Rocket Companies, Inc.
(the &#8220;Company&#8221;) announced today that it has entered into an agreement to simplify its organizational and capital
structure. Under the Transaction Agreement (as defined below), the Company will collapse its current &#8220;Up-C&#8221; structure,
provide that each class of common stock of the Company will be entitled to one vote per share, and reduce its classes of common
stock from four to two. Following the Up-C Collapse (as defined below), the public stockholders will continue to hold their current
shares of common stock, while Mr. Daniel Gilbert and the other stockholders of Rock Holdings Inc. (&#8220;RHI&#8221;) will hold
shares of common stock directly in the Company, instead of through RHI, and will no longer hold limited liability company interests
(the &#8220;Holdings LLC Units&#8221;) of Rocket, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company and principal operating subsidiary of
the Company (&#8220;Holdings LLC&#8221;). Additionally, the shares of common stock to be directly held by Mr. Gilbert and the other
stockholders of RHI will carry one vote per share, as opposed to the ten votes per share of the Class D Common Stock (as defined
below) they currently hold, directly or indirectly through RHI, in the Company. As part of the Up-C Collapse, Mr. Gilbert and the
other stockholders of RHI will be prohibited from transferring or otherwise disposing of (a) the shares they receive in the Up-C
Collapse prior to the first anniversary of the date of the closing of the Up-C Collapse (the &#8220;Closing Date&#8221;) and (b) 50%
of their shares prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in; margin-right: 0; margin-left: 0">In connection
with the Up-C Collapse, the Company&#8217;s board of directors authorized and declared a cash dividend (the &#8220;Special Dividend&#8221;)
of $0.80 per share to the holders of the Company&#8217;s Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the &#8220;Class A Common
Stock&#8221;).&#160;The Special Dividend will be paid on April 3, 2025 to holders of the Class A Common Stock of record as of the close
of business on March 20, 2025. The Special Dividend will be paid prior to the Up-C Collapse so no dividend will be payable with respect
to the shares of Class L Common Stock (as defined below) received by Mr. Gilbert and other RHI stockholders in the Up-C Collapse, as those
stockholders previously received the economic benefit of such distribution on account of their Holdings LLC Units.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-align: left; text-indent: 0.5in">The Company believes that
the simplification of its organizational structure and providing that all shares of common stock of the Company will be entitled to one
vote per share will provide various benefits to the Company and its stockholders, including, among other things, enhancing equity liquidity, improving the Company&rsquo;s ability to use its common stock as acquisition currency in acquisition transactions and creating a clearer corporate profile.</P>

a Michigan corporation and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Merger Sub 1&#8221;), Rocket GP, LLC, a Michigan limited
liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of the Company (&#8220;Merger Sub 2&#8221;), Mr. Gilbert, its founder and
Chairman, and RHI II, LLC, a Michigan limited liability company and a direct wholly owned subsidiary of RHI (&#8220;RHI II&#8221;), to
effectuate all transactions pursuant to or related to the Transaction Agreement (the &#8220;Up-C Collapse&#8221;).</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">Under its existing organizational structure,
the Company is a holding company and its principal asset is its ownership of Holdings LLC Units. The Company is also the sole managing
member of Holdings LLC. The Company&#8217;s public stockholders hold all of the issued and outstanding shares of Class A Common Stock,
which are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and have economic rights (including rights
to dividends and distributions upon liquidation by the Company). RHI and Mr. Gilbert hold (a) all of the issued and outstanding shares
of the Company&#8217;s Class D common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the &#8220;Class D Common Stock&#8221;), which are entitled
to ten votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, but have no economic rights, and (b) an equal number of Holdings
LLC Units, which have economic rights (including rights to dividends and distributions upon liquidation by Holdings LLC), but have no
voting rights. The Company&#8217;s certificate of incorporation provides that, at any time when the aggregate voting power of the securities
beneficially owned by RHI (the &#8220;RHI Securities&#8221;) would be equal to or greater than 79% of the total voting power of the Company&#8217;s
outstanding stock, the number of votes per share of each RHI Security will be reduced such that the aggregate voting power of all of the

Collapse, (a) RHI shareholders, in consideration for their common shares of RHI, and (b) Mr. Gilbert, in consideration for his Class
D Common Stock and paired Holdings LLC Units, will receive a number of newly issued shares of the Company&#8217;s Class L common
stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the &#8220;Class L Common Stock&#8221;) equivalent to one share of Class L Common Stock for
each share of Class D Common Stock held by RHI and Mr. Gilbert. The shares of Class L Common Stock will be entitled to one vote per
share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders and will have economic rights (including rights to dividends and
distributions upon liquidation by the Company) that are the same as the Class A Common Stock. As a result, Mr. Gilbert and the other RHI shareholders will no longer have

to certain limited exceptions, Mr. Gilbert and the other RHI shareholders will be prohibited from transferring or otherwise disposing
of (a) any shares of Class L Common Stock prior to the first anniversary of the Closing Date and (b) 50% of the shares of Class L Common
Stock prior to the second anniversary of the Closing Date (all such periods together, the &#8220;Lock-up Periods&#8221;). Additionally,
the Company&#8217;s certificate of incorporation following the Up-C Collapse will provide that, at any time when the aggregate voting
power of the outstanding Class L Common Stock would be equal to or greater than 79% of the total voting power of the Company&#8217;s outstanding
stock, the number of votes per share of each share of Class L Common Stock will be reduced such that the aggregate voting power of all
shares of Class L Common Stock is equal to 79%. Following the expiration or waiver of the Lock-up Periods, each share of Class L Common
Stock (i) may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into one share of Class A Common Stock and (ii) will automatically
convert into one share of Class A Common Stock immediately prior to any transfer of such share except for certain permitted transfers
that will be described in the Company&#8217;s certificate of incorporation. In addition, upon the later to occur of (A) the expiration
or waiver of the Lock-up Periods and (B) the date that the outstanding shares of Class L Common Stock no longer represent at least 79%
of the total voting power of the issued and outstanding shares of our common stock, all shares of Class L Common Stock will automatically
convert to newly issued shares of Class A Common Stock. The Company intends to issue the shares of Class L Common Stock in reliance upon
the exemption from registration afforded by Section 4(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and the rules thereunder, in light
of the character of the RHI shareholders and the manner in which the Up-C Collapse would occur.</P>

the combined voting power on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders. As a result, the Company expects to continue to remain a
