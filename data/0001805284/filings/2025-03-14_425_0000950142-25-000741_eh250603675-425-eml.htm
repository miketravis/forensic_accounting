<P STYLE="font: 10pt WNTL Text,sans-serif; margin: 0">I&rsquo;m feeling so grateful for the warm welcome you gave me at your Seattle office
this week. I had the opportunity to meet some of you in-person and to join Glenn during your All Hands meeting. During every interaction,
I felt the strength of the Redfin culture and I am more confident than ever about our bright shared future ahead.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt WNTL Text,sans-serif; margin: 0">It&rsquo;s worth repeating that I have been a longtime fan of Redfin as you are
one of the true innovators in real estate. In many ways, as I get to know your team and company better, it feels familiar. Like Redfin,
Rocket is a mission-driven company at the intersection of service and technology. We both have deep roots of challenging the status quo
in our industry to deliver a better experience for the consumer. Together, we will be able to combine the strengths of our teams to redefine
the homeownership journey.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt WNTL Text,sans-serif; margin: 0">I want to emphasize that bringing our companies together is about growth. We&rsquo;re
excited to invest in Redfin because we know that the brand, data, agents and overall team will enable us to help more consumers find and
purchase their home. After the deal closes and we succeed in this, we expect growth opportunities for our team members as well.</P>
