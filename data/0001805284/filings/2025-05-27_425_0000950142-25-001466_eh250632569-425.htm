<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Hey, what's up, Redfin team? I'm here with the
man, the myth, the legend. Glenn Kelman. Hi. We're hanging out in Detroit. Team, this summer has started off with a bang, and we're knee
deep in integration planning. I wanted to say one thing. I has gotten to know the Redfin team and spent some time in Seattle, and I'm
just so impressed with the talent with the energy, with the competitive spirit and the culture.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">00:00:23:16 - 00:00:33:20</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">And we've been working super hard. We've got a
lot of progress and we've got more progress to make, and we're speeding toward our closing date. Glenn, what are your thoughts on how
the integration is going so far?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Right back at you; Redfin has been blown away
by the Rocket team. We've got to get as many of you out to Detroit as we possibly can, because seeing this place is a religious experience.
What Rocket has done for the town of Detroit, how Rocket operates, it is at another level. So we are really excited about the integration.</P>

to close this baby down and then we can really start working together, sharing sales opportunities between the two organizations, sharing
technology best practices, working as one. It's going to be so much fun.</P>

I do want to say is over the past couple of weeks especially, I don't know, I already was a daily active user of Redfin in my app
usage right now. We got to ask Bridget to track the analytics, but I think I'm coming up day over day. But the new app design is
fire. It&rsquo;s fire.</P>

this just as a product person, I am now incredibly biased. But we do have the best product. And I think when you take the Redfin app,
you connect it with Rocket&rsquo;s financing engine, Mr. Cooper servicing. You put all of that together. We're going to create something special.</P>
