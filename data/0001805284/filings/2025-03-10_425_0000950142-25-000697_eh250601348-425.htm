by information in a confidential disclosure letter provided by Redfin to the Company in connection with the signing of the Merger Agreement
or in filings of the parties with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#8220;SEC&#8221;). This confidential disclosure
letter contains information that modifies, qualifies and creates exceptions to the representations and warranties and certain covenants

after the date of the Merger Agreement, which subsequent information may or may not be fully reflected in the Company&#8217;s or Redfin&#8217;s
public disclosures. Moreover, the representations and warranties in the Merger Agreement were used for the purposes of allocating risk
between the Company and Redfin rather than establishing matters of fact. In addition, investors are not third-party beneficiaries under
