Pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, each RHI shareholder, in consideration for its voting common shares of RHI, par value $0.001 per share (the "RHI Shares"), received for each RHI Share 56.54 newly issued shares of Rocket Class L common stock, par value $0.00001 per share (the "Class L Common Stock"), half of which are designated Class L-1 Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share ("Class L-1 Common Stock"), and half of which are designated Class L-2 Common Stock, par value $0.00001 per share ("Class L-2 Common Stock"). Additionally, pursuant to the Transaction Agreement, Daniel Gilbert contributed and transferred to Rocket his shares of Rocket Class D common stock, par value $0.00001 per share ("Class D Common Stock") and corresponding non-voting common interest units of Rocket Limited Partnership (as successor in interest to Rocket, LLC) ("Rocket LP") and received shares of Class L Common Stock on a one-to-one basis, half of which are designated Class L-1 Common Stock and half of which are designated Class L-2 Common Stock.

Following June 30, 2026, each share of Class L-1 common stock (i) may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into one share of Rocket Class A common stock, par value $0.00001 per share ("Class A Common Stock") and (ii) will automatically convert into one share of Class A Common Stock immediately prior to any transfer of such share, except for certain permitted transfers that are described in Rocket's certificate of incorporation. Following June 30, 2027, each share of Class L-2 Common Stock (i) may be converted at any time, at the option of the holder, into one share of Class A Common Stock and (ii) will automatically convert into one share of Class A Common Stock immediately prior to any transfer of such share, except for certain permitted transfers that are described in Rocket's certificate of incorporation.

Each Reporting Person was a shareholder of RHI. As part of the Up-C collapse, each Reporting Person acquired beneficial ownership over the common stock of the Issuer reported on the cover pages of this Schedule 13D.

Subject to certain limited exceptions as provided in Rocket's certificate of incorporation, (i) holders of Class L-1 Common Stock are prohibited from transferring or otherwise disposing of such shares prior to June 30, 2026, and (ii) holders of Class L-2 Common Stock are prohibited from transferring or otherwise disposing of such shares prior to June 30, 2027.

The Transaction Agreement is filed as Exhibit 1 hereto and is incorporated herein by reference.

Following the transactions contemplated in this Schedule 13D, Daniel Gilbert, who is the Chairman of the Board, continues to hold more than a majority of the combined voting power of the outstanding capital stock of the Issuer and therefore can approve or disapprove any matter requiring a majority vote of the Issuer's stockholders.
