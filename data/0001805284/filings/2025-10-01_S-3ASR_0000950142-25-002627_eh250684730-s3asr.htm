risk. You should carefully consider the specific risks discussed or incorporated by reference in this prospectus and under similar headings
in the documents that are, together with all the other information incorporated by reference in this prospectus. You should also consider
the risks, uncertainties and assumptions discussed under the caption &ldquo;Risk Factors&rdquo; included in the 2024 Annual Report and
the First Quarter 10-Q, both of which are incorporated by reference into this prospectus, and which may be amended, supplemented or superseded
from time to time by other reports we file with the SEC in the future. The occurrence of any of these risks might cause you to lose all
or part of your investment in the offered securities. There may be other unknown or unpredictable economic, business, competitive, regulatory
or other factors that could have material adverse effects on our future results. Past financial performance may not be a reliable indicator
of future performance, and historical trends should not be used to anticipate results or trends in future periods. If any of these risks
actually occurs, our business, financial condition, results, operations or cash flow could be seriously harmed. This could cause the trading
price of our Class A common stock to decline, resulting in a loss of all or part of your investment.</P>

of the combined voting power of our common stock, any director may be removed with or without cause by the affirmative vote of a majority
of our outstanding shares of common stock.</P>

after the Gilberts cease to beneficially own a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, vacancies on our board of directors,
whether resulting from an increase in the number of directors or the death, removal or resignation of a director, will be filled only

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Amendments to Certificate of Incorporation
and Bylaws.</I> The DGCL generally provides that the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of the total voting power of the shares
entitled to vote on any matter is required to amend a corporation&rsquo;s certificate of incorporation or bylaws, unless either a corporation&rsquo;s
certificate of incorporation or bylaws require a greater percentage. Our certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, after the
Gilberts cease to beneficially own a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, the affirmative vote of holders of 75%
of the combined voting power of our outstanding common stock eligible to vote in the election of directors, voting together as a single
class, will be required to amend, alter, change or repeal our bylaws or specified provisions of our certificate of incorporation, including
those relating to the classified board, actions by written consent of stockholders, calling of special meetings of stockholders, business
combinations and these vote requirements to amend our certificate of incorporation and bylaws. This requirement of a super-majority vote
to approve certain amendments to our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could enable a minority of our stockholders to exercise veto
power over any such amendments.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Special Meetings of Stockholders.</I> Our
certificate of incorporation and bylaws provide that, subject to any special rights of the holders of any series of Preferred Stock, special
meetings of the stockholders can only be called by the chairman of our board of directors or the chief executive officer, or by our board
of directors. Except as described above, stockholders are not permitted to call a special meeting or to require our board of directors
to call a special meeting.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Action by Written Consent.</I> Our certificate
of incorporation provides that stockholder action can be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting; provided that after the Gilberts
cease to beneficially own a majority of the combined voting power of our common stock, stockholder action can be taken only at an annual
or special meeting of stockholders and cannot be taken by written consent in lieu of a meeting.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Advance Notice Procedures.</I> Our bylaws
establish an advance notice procedure for stockholder proposals to be brought before an annual meeting of our stockholders, including
proposed nominations of persons for election to our board of directors. Stockholders at an annual meeting are only able to consider proposals
or nominations specified in the notice of meeting or brought before the meeting by or at the direction of our board of directors or by
a stockholder who was a stockholder of record on the record date for the meeting, who is entitled to vote at the meeting and who has given
us timely written notice, in proper form, of the stockholder&rsquo;s intention to bring that business before the meeting. Although the
bylaws do not give our board of directors the power to approve or disapprove stockholder nominations of candidates or proposals regarding
other business to be conducted at a special or annual meeting, the bylaws may have the effect of precluding the conduct of certain business
at a meeting if the proper procedures are not followed or may discourage or deter a potential acquirer from conducting a solicitation
of proxies to elect its own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of the Company.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Authorized but Unissued Shares.</I> Our authorized
but unissued shares of common stock and Preferred Stock are available for future issuance without stockholder approval, subject to applicable
NYSE rules. These additional shares may be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes, including future public offerings to raise additional
capital, corporate acquisitions and employee benefit plans. The existence of authorized but unissued shares of common stock and Preferred
Stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of a majority of our common stock by means of a proxy contest,
tender offer, merger or otherwise.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in"><I>Business Combinations with Interested Stockholders.</I>
Our certificate of incorporation provides that we will not be subject to Section 203 of the DGCL, an antitakeover law. In general, Section
203 prohibits a publicly held Delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder, unless the
business combination is approved in a prescribed manner. An interested stockholder includes a person, individually or together with any
other interested stockholder, who within the last three years has owned 15% or more of our voting stock. Accordingly, we will not be subject
to any anti-takeover effects of Section 203. Nevertheless, our certificate of incorporation includes a provision that restricts us from
engaging in any business combination with an interested stockholder for three years following the date that person becomes an interested
stockholder. Such restrictions, however, do not apply to any business combination between RHI II, any Rock Equityholder, any of their
respective affiliates or successors or any of or any &ldquo;group,&rdquo; or any member of any such group, to which such persons are a
party under Rule 13d-5 of the Exchange Act.</P>

requires, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that (i) any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf, (ii) any action
asserting a claim of breach of a fiduciary duty owed by any of our directors, officers or stockholders to us or our stockholders, (iii)
any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to any provision of the DGCL or our certificate of incorporation or our bylaws
or (iv) any action asserting a claim against us governed by the internal affairs doctrine will have to be brought only in the Third Judicial
Circuit, Wayne County, Michigan (or, if the Third Judicial Circuit, Wayne County, Michigan lacks jurisdiction over such action or proceeding,
then another state court of the State of Michigan or, if no state court of the State of Michigan has jurisdiction, then the United States
District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan) or the Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware (or if the Court of Chancery of
the State of Delaware lacks jurisdiction, any other state court of the State of Delaware, or if no state of the State of Delaware has
jurisdiction, the federal district court for the District of Delaware), unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative
forum. Additionally, our certificate of incorporation states that the foregoing provision will not apply to claims arising under the Securities
Act, the Exchange Act or other federal securities laws for which there is exclusive federal or concurrent federal and state jurisdiction.
Unless we consent in writing to the selection of an alternative forum, the federal district courts of the United States of America will
be the exclusive forum for the resolution of any complaint asserting a cause of action arising under the Securities Act. The exclusive
forum provisions may limit a stockholder&rsquo;s ability to bring a claim in a judicial forum that it finds favorable for disputes with
us or any of our directors, officers or stockholders, which may discourage lawsuits with respect to such claims. Our stockholders will
not be deemed to have waived our compliance with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder as a result of our
exclusive forum provisions.</P>

INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">The following is a brief summary of certain
U.S. federal income tax consequences applicable restricted stock units granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan based on the federal income
tax laws in effect on the date of this registration statement. This summary is not intended to be exhaustive and does not address all
matters relevant to a particular participant based on their specific circumstances. The summary expressly does not discuss the income
tax laws of any state, municipality, or&nbsp;non-U.S.&nbsp;taxing jurisdiction, or the gift, estate, excise (including the rules applicable
to deferred compensation under Section&nbsp;409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the &ldquo;Code&rdquo;)), or other tax laws other
than U.S. federal income tax law. Because individual circumstances may vary, we advise all participants to consult their own tax advisor
concerning the tax implications of restricted stock units granted under the Omnibus Incentive Plan.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in"><B>Restricted Stock Units</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">Generally, the holder of a restricted stock
unit will recognize taxable income when a restricted stock unit is settled in shares of common stock or cash, as applicable, and we may
be eligible for a deduction for federal income tax purposes in the same amount, subject to limitations such as under Section 162(m) of
the Code. The taxable income from the award generally will be equal to the fair market value of the shares on such date. This income is
taxed in the same manner and at the same rates as other compensation income. Taxable income recognized by former employees from the award
may be subject to federal income tax withholding, as well as any applicable state and local income tax withholding and FICA tax withholding.
There may be individual considerations for restricted stock units which are considered deferred compensation.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0.5in">The holder may incur a tax liability when subsequently
disposing of shares acquired from the restricted stock unit award if those shares are sold at a gain. Generally an amount equal to the
difference between the sale or other disposition price of such shares and the cost basis of such shares will be treated as a capital gain
or loss. The cost basis of the shares is equal to the amount previously taxed as compensation income.</P>

outstanding equity awards under the Omnibus Incentive Plan pursuant to the Merger Agreement. The registration statement of which this
prospectus forms a part covers the issuance of Class A common stock upon the settlement of certain assumed restricted stock units under
the Omnibus Incentive Plan that are held by former service providers of Mr. Cooper. The restricted stock units are generally subject to
the same terms and conditions (other than performance-based conditions determined prior to the Effective Time pursuant to the Merger Agreement)
that applied to the Mr. Cooper restricted stock units immediately before the&nbsp;Mr. Cooper Acquisition, except for adjustments to the
number of shares as provided in the Merger Agreement.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.5in">The tax consequences of awards granted under the plan
are complex and may depend on the surrounding facts and circumstances. The following provides a brief summary of certain significant United
States federal income tax consequences to a participant who is a citizen or resident of the United States under existing U.S. laws as
of the date of this prospectus. This summary is not a complete statement of applicable law and is based upon the Code, the regulations
promulgated thereunder as well as administrative and judicial interpretations of the Code as in effect on the date of this description.
If federal tax laws, or the interpretations of such laws, change in the future, the information provided in this section may no longer
be accurate. This section does not discuss state, local, employment or foreign tax consequences and does not discuss the loss of deduction
provisions of Section 280G of the Code, the excise tax provisions of Section 4999 of the Code, the Medicare contribution tax on &ldquo;net
investment income&rdquo; of Section 1411 of the Code, or the consequences of a failure to comply with Section 409A of the Code, each of
which may be applicable in the circumstances described below. This section also does not discuss the effect of gift, estate or inheritance
taxes which may be applicable. <B><I>Therefore, it is recommended that you consult with your tax advisor before taking any action with

of a non-qualified option with an exercise price at least equal to the fair market value of the shares on the date of the grant. You will
have taxable income upon the exercise of a non-qualified option equal to the excess of the fair market value of our common stock over
the option price multiplied by the number of shares subject to exercise (referred to as the &ldquo;option spread&rdquo;), and we will
generally be entitled to deduct that amount for federal income tax purposes. This taxable income will be taxed to you as ordinary compensation
income.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Taxable income you recognize from your exercise of

of shares acquired from your option if these shares are sold at a gain. You will be responsible for paying any tax due and ensuring that
any sale by you of the shares is reported to the tax authorities as required by applicable law. When you sell or otherwise dispose of
your shares, an amount equal to the difference between the sale or other disposition price of these shares and the cost basis of these
shares will be treated as a capital gain or loss. The cost basis is generally equal to the amount previously taxed to you as compensation
income plus the option price.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.5in">If the shares that you sell at a gain have been held
for one year or less, a short-term capital gain will be recognized, which gain is subject to tax at ordinary income tax rates. For shares
that you sell at a gain that have been held more than one year, a long-term capital gain will be recognized, which is currently subject
to tax at reduced rates. If you sell the shares at a loss because the cost basis of the shares exceeds the sale or other disposition price
of the shares, the loss will be a capital loss. There are limits on the deductibility of capital losses.</P>

be subject to income taxation only when you dispose of the shares you acquired upon the exercise of an incentive stock option. If you
dispose of the shares of common stock that you acquired upon exercise of an incentive stock option more than two years after the date

compensation income in the year you disposed of the incentive stock option shares in an amount equal to the excess (if any) of (i) the
fair market value of such shares on the date of exercise over (ii) the option price, and the Company will be entitled to deduct that amount
for federal income tax purposes. Any further gain (or loss) that you realize upon the disqualified disposition of the shares of common

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0.5in">Although your exercise of an incentive stock option
does not result in the recognition of regular taxable income, the option spread on an incentive stock option exercise is a preference
item that is includible in the calculation of your federal alternative minimum taxable income. Therefore, the exercise of an incentive
stock option may cause an increase in your federal income tax liability if the preference income from an incentive stock option exercise
causes your alternative minimum tax to exceed (or further exceed) your regular federal income tax in the year of the exercise.</P>

received on the exercise. We will generally be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes at the same time equal to the amount

a restricted stock or restricted stock unit award, unless you make an election pursuant to Section 83(b) of the Code with respect to the
restricted stock award. Generally, you will recognize taxable income on the date an award of restricted stock becomes transferable or
is no longer subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture (i.e., the vesting date) or when a restricted stock unit is settled in shares
of common stock or cash, as applicable, and we will generally be entitled to a deduction for federal income tax purposes in the same amount.
The taxable income from your award will be equal to the difference between the fair market value of the shares on such date and the amount
paid for such shares, if any. This income is taxed in the same manner and at the same rates as other compensation income. If you do make
an election under Section 83(b) of the Code, to the extent applicable, you will have taxable income at the time of grant equal to the

law. When you sell or otherwise dispose of any shares of common stock, an amount equal to the difference between the sale or other disposition

to the amount previously taxed as compensation income plus any amounts paid for the shares. The holding period of such shares begins on
the date such shares are vested (or, where an election is made under Section 83(b) of the Code, on the date they were issued). If the

a claim for indemnification against such liabilities (other than the payment by a registrant of expenses incurred or paid by a director,
officer or controlling person of such registrant in the successful defense of any action, suit or proceeding) is asserted by such director,
officer or controlling person in connection with the securities being registered, the registrant will, unless in the opinion of its counsel
the matter has been settled by controlling precedent, submit to a court of appropriate jurisdiction the question whether such indemnification
by it is against public policy as expressed in the Securities Act and will be governed by the final adjudication of such issue.</TD></TR></TABLE>
