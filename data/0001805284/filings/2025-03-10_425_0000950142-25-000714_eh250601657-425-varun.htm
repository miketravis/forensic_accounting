<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">What's up Rocket? Varun here. I hope you're having an amazing week.
And happy Monday to all of you. We have a little bit of an announcement to make, and I'm so excited to share this with all of you. Today
we are announcing to the world that Rocket is entering into a strategic agreement to acquire Redfin.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">00:00:19:08 - 00:00:37:05</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">And I wanted to just step back and give you a chance to understand
why I'm so excited about this deal and how I think it creates amazing opportunities for a Rocket in the future. The first thing I want
to say is that everyone has heard of Redfin. Redfin is one of the powerhouses in the real estate and home search space.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">00:00:37:06 - 00:01:02:19</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">They have over 50 million monthly active users, and they're based
and headquartered in Seattle. Some of you already know this, but Seattle is where, I started my career, and it's where, I have spent a
lot of time. And so I've been a big fan and a long time admirer of Redfin, and I was actually one of their first monthly active users
way back when the company started in around 2005.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">00:01:02:21 - 00:01:38:23</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">Redfin is a perfect fit for Rocket, and they
are incredibly complimentary to our culture and who we are. There's a few things that are really exciting about this deal that I want
to unpack for you. The first is the acceleration of our purchase strategy. As you know, purchase is one of the things that we've been
talking about in terms of our aspirations for long term growth, especially when it comes to growing profitable market share, and by accessing
Redfin's 50 million monthly active users, there are incredible a partner agent network, as well as their in-house real estate professionals
that work for the company.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">We can connect our mortgage funnel to their purchase funnel and create
an unbelievable experience for our mutual clients. The other thing that's really exciting about this deal is that it accelerates our AI
strategy in a world that is very, very quickly evolving into the AI revolution. Access to data, more relationships, more distribution
is one of the things that will separate winners from losers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">And so I am so excited about this deal. I think you have two companies
that are incredibly complementary. And I also want to highlight one thing for you, which is our culture. I've gotten to know Glenn Kelman,
the Redfin CEO. In fact, I'm actually going to leave this video and go hop on a plane and go spend some time with him.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">We're going to do some media. We're going to do a town hall with the
Redfin team, and he and the Redfin team could not be more excited for Rocket because they are longtime admirers of our culture. Its actually
funny, one story I'll share with you is that Glenn has actually toured the Rocket offices multiple times. He's an expert in our isms,
and it's one of the things that he's most excited about when it comes to joining forces with the Rocket team.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">00:02:45:03 - 00:03:01:08</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Arial, Helvetica, Sans-Serif; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt">So a lot of news, a lot of things to unpack. I'm going to link some
content for you so that you know what to expect and what to look forward to. We're expecting this deal to close sometime in the second
half of this year, and I'm just so excited about it. So thank you for listening. I hope you found this helpful.</P>
