<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-indent: 0in">July 31, 2025</P>

Woods, Inc.:</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Actually, historically, you guys obviously didn't
hedge your MSR, given the very high recapture rates, but just given that the recapture rates on the Cooper MSR will be lower, just given
a lot of that is acquired, et cetera, just what are your thoughts about the hedge strategy and on a combined basis going forward?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in"><B>Brian Brown:</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">So as it relates first, I'll start with your &ndash;
answer your question directly on the Cooper side, but I do want to talk a little bit about just the Rocket proper side and the hedge there,
too. So as it relates to the Cooper side, the plan is to continue hedging the combined portfolios. Cooper does a really nice job about
that. I think they target around 70% coverage. So if you're thinking about, hey, it's the day after close, I don't expect any change there.
And the reason for that is because we have to prove to ourselves that these recapture synergies are going to come in. And as we start
having more data and real information, we will continue to reevaluate that because to your point, there is a real natural hedge between
the MSR value fluctuations and the recapture business.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">But on the Rocket side we haven't hedged. I want
to point that out. And we primarily hedged the MSR assets that we plan to sell. So it's been more of a temporary hedge. But as we continue
to evaluate our strategy, we did layer on a hedge during the quarter really around that float assumption. And that's to preserve the float
earnings component of the MSR value, particularly on those lower note rates that are unlikely to pay off anytime soon. So you'll see that
in the financials when we file the Q. We're being very thoughtful about it. But that float earnings assumption, which is based on the
short term side of the curve, we did put a hedge on to try to preserve that.</P>

Co. LLC:</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">I was hoping we could maybe just talk quickly
about Mr. Cooper. I know the deal is still not closed yet, but now that another several months has gone by, I'm just curious whether you
still think those synergies are on track and maybe you could comment a little bit on. If you've done any more work or incremental work
into whether you think that that 65% recapture rate assumption could be considered the correct number, et cetera?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Yeah, thanks for the question, Jeff. I'll start
just by talking about the context and progress that we're making on the deal, and then I'll ask Brian to jump in as well. But let me just
start by talking about why Mr. Cooper and Rocket make sense. And at the heart of it is just our ability to build lifetime value, long-term
relationships with clients. And that's essentially what servicing represents, right, the ability to serve a client for the entirety of
their loan experience. And our thesis is that if we do a good job with that, we earn the right to recapture them for a new loan, which
is core to our strategy. And ultimately, if we do that right, we end up reducing the cost of acquisition, which allows us to pass on more
value, more savings directly to the client.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Now, I would say in terms of our progress toward
closing, we're very pleased with the progress. We're on track for a Q4 close. We received HSR approval. We're advancing with state level
regulators, with the GSEs and of course with FHFA. It is a large, complex transaction, but the process is moving as expected and the teams
from both organizations are collaborating very closely and it is our number one priority across the company. Brian, is there anything
you would want to add?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in"><B>Brian Brown:</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">The only thing I would add is every day that we've
made progress since the last update, we just keep building on the conviction around the synergy numbers. This is similar to the Redfin
update other than the fact we're not closed here. I would say the line of sight on the expense side makes us feel really good and the
work that we're doing in terms of tearing apart the recapture only gives us more conviction. So as we sit here today, the only way I can
probably answer that question is conviction continues to increase. And we're very confident in the numbers.</P>
