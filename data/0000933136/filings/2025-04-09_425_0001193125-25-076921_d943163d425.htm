<P STYLE="margin-top:24pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman" ALIGN="center"><B>HANDLING TRIGGER LEADS WITH COMPETITORS </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>What is a &#147;trigger lead,&#148; and why am I being contacted by another mortgage company? </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">A &#147;trigger lead&#148; is a lead generated when your credit report is run as part of the mortgage application process. The lead indicates to other mortgage
lenders that you may be in the market for a purchase, refinance or an equity loan. Rocket may be one of the companies contacting you because of that trigger notification they receive. I can help you move forward business as usual. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>What will happen to my current loan service once the acquisition is complete? </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Once the acquisition is complete, the combined company will service your loan under the Rocket Mortgage brand. Ahead of that change, we will be in touch with
all the information you&#146;ll need. For now, everything is staying the same. Rest assured: No terms or conditions of your mortgage will be affected by this transition, and soon you will get to enjoy all the benefits that both Mr.&nbsp;Cooper and
Rocket Mortgage have to offer. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Can I still work with the same loan officer after the acquisition? </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Yes, as your loan officer, I will continue to be available to you, and we&#146;re committed to maintaining the same high level of service. It&#146;s important
to keep in mind that the acquisition won&#146;t be complete until later this year, and your current [refinance/purchase/etc.] should be complete by that time. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;ll ensure you have continued support throughout the entire process. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>Should I wait until the acquisition is complete to apply for a loan or refinance? </B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">You and I can move forward on your loan/refinancing now without worrying about the acquisition, especially knowing it isn&#146;t expected to close until later
this year. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">We&#146;ll continue to process your loan with the same care and attention. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">The process won&#146;t be disrupted, and you won&#146;t need to start anything over when the acquisition is finalized. </P>

same excellent service you&#146;ve been getting. We&#146;ll keep you informed every step of the way, and we&#146;ll make sure the transition process is smooth. </P>

information, and we&#146;ll continue to provide you with the same level of service you&#146;ve come to expect from us. </P>
