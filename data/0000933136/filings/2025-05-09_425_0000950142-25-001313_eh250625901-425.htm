<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in"><B>Varun Krishna:</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Integration is a top priority for our leadership
team right now. Over the past several weeks, we&rsquo;ve been working closely with leaders at Redfin and Mr. Cooper, and we&rsquo;re more
energized than ever. Integration is also a multi-faceted process, and it is our top priority across the entire company. We share a culture
of innovation and driving change through technology and a vision to build the future of homeownership.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in"><B>Brian Brown:</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Our collective teams across all three
companies are already working hard, putting together detailed integration plans including clear milestones. We&rsquo;ve identified
more than 35 integration workstreams, formed several steering committees, and we&rsquo;re moving quickly and decisively to ensure we
can start to realize synergy value after closing.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Following the completion of both all-stock transactions&mdash;Redfin
and Mr. Cooper&mdash;we expect our Class A public float to increase from approximately 7 percent today to around 35 percent.</P>

Inc.:</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0pt; text-indent: 0in">So, I'd like to ask about just your post-merger
with Mr. Cooper Group, your subservicing strategy going forward. Obviously, it's kind of a big part of their business. And we've seen,
at least one notable client defection since the deal was announced. Obviously, having subservicing with a company like Rocket, it's much
more effective at recapturing maybe a greater threat. So, I'm just &ndash; how are you thinking about retention of subservicing agreements
going forward and the ability to kind of grow that?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in"><B>Brian Brown: </B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Yeah, Mark, let me touch on the first part of
your question, and then Varun may have a comment or two. I can't comment on the COOP business. We do need to run as two independent companies
right now. But I think there's two things I'd point you to. One is, from the Rocket perspective, we fully support the subservicing business.
There's no question about that. What COOP's built and particularly being able to scale through subservicing is part of the aspect that's
been very impressive to us. And if you go back to COOP's earnings call and look at some of the comments they made, they talked a lot about
the fact that they have actually been increasing the pipeline on the subservicing business and haven't seen any material changes. So,
if I leave my comments to just post- closing, we're very excited about that business. We fully support it. And we plan, as we said publicly,
to completely honor the contractual provisions with those subservicers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in"><B>Bose George, Analyst, Keefe, Bruyette &amp;
Woods, Inc.:</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">Just a follow-up on the earlier question on market
share, do you think you might explore other acquisitions especially to grow purchase market share? And is the acquisition of distributed
retail capacity something you could consider?</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in"><B>Varun Krishna: </B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 2.7pt 20.9pt 12pt 0; text-indent: 0in">I think, what I would say right now
is, with the criticality of the integration that we have, we're absolutely focused on these two. I think we're super excited about these
deals. They're directly in service to our long-term strategy. And we think that it's very relevant to our purchase strategy goals. And
just to kind of recap that, we want to establish a top of funnel, build relationships with clients that are searching for homes, as well
as with real estate agents and experts. And this is directly in service to that with Redfin. And we want to build a broker strategy, as
I, obviously just talked about with the earlier question. And we want to drive the recapture flywheel, which is really powered by servicing.
And so, we are knee deep in integration preparation, and we're really excited and happy with how it's going. But this will be the primary
focus for us just to make sure that we build these key pillars of our integration platform.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in"><B>Mihir Bhatia, Analyst, BofA Securities, Inc.:
</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">And then, maybe just switching back for a second
to subservicing and protection. And also maybe related to subservicing, just protections, the brokers when you are servicing loans in
the broker channel, there's been a lot of talk just about that and about the potential for Rocket being a competitor, but also going to
be doing subservicing others may want to switch, et cetera. Can you just take a couple of minutes to just talk about that. What kind of
protections do MSR owners have in these typical subservicing arrangements and similarly for the brokers that work with Rocket? Thank you.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in"><B>Brian Brown:</B></P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 0pt; text-indent: 0in">It's either you have a non-solicit or I guess
they put it in three buckets Mihir. If you're speaking about doing subservicing and we announced the Annaly deal earlier, there's a way
that Rocket can help them actually do the recapture. If you're an asset manager and you come to Rocket to do subservicing, you own the
MSR, we're going to do the subservice, there's a really awesome opportunity because we can do the recapture which protects that asset,
extends the cash flows, and it's a win for the servicer and it's a win or the &ndash; yeah, win for the owned servicer and it's a win
for Rocket.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 10pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0 0 12pt; text-indent: 0in">And then, when you talk &ndash; when you take
it one step further into subservicing, similarly, you can either help the client do recapture or not. And we're open to both. But if
you don't help the client recapture, then you're not going to solicit those clients or you're not going to be a subservicer for long.
And our comments are that we support all three of those models. Obviously, Cooper does all three. Rocket does two of them today. We'll
do three upon the close of the transaction. But we're very supportive of it, and that's one of the exciting things about this acquisition.</P>
