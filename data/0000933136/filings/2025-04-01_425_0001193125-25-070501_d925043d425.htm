All determinations made by the Accounting Firm under this Section&nbsp;4 shall be binding upon the Company, its Affiliates and the Participant and shall be made as soon as reasonably practicable and in no event later than 15 days following the Date

under Treas. Regs. &#167;&nbsp;1.280G-1, Q&amp;A-24(c) (&#147;<B>24(c)</B>&#148;), (b)&nbsp;equity-based payments that may not be valued under 24(c), (c)&nbsp;cash payments that may be valued under 24(c), and (d)&nbsp;equity-based payments that may

the farthest in time from the Date of Termination, based on the Accounting Firm&#146;s determination. All determinations of the Account Firm shall be conclusive and binding on the Company and its Affiliates (including following the applicable Change

Revenue Service against the Company or the Participant that the Accounting Firm believes has a high probability of success, determines that an Overpayment has been made, any such Overpayment paid or distributed by the Company to or for the benefit
of the Participant shall be repaid by the Participant to the Company (as applicable) together with interest at the applicable federal rate provided for in Section&nbsp;7872(f)(2) of the Code; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that no such repayment
shall be required if and to the extent such deemed repayment would not either reduce the amount on which the Participant is subject to tax under Section&nbsp;1 and Section&nbsp;4999 of the Code or generate a refund of such taxes. If the Accounting
