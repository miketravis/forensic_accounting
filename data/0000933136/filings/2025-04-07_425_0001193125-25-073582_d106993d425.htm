<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mr.&nbsp;Cooper Team,</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I hope you are feeling as excited as I am
about Mr.&nbsp;Cooper and Rocket joining forces. Together we will be on a journey to build the future of homeownership.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mr.&nbsp;Cooper is a force in the
industry, and I have long admired the business you have built together. Early in my time as Rocket CEO I had the opportunity to meet Jay and we immediately connected on our companies&#146; shared culture and vision. As we explored bringing our two
companies together, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into your organization, and what I have learned has only reinforced how confident I am that your team will strengthen Rocket&#146;s culture and company overall.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mr.&nbsp;Cooper&#146;s core values of challenging convention, being champions for your customers and cheerleaders for your team are very similar to
Rocket&#146;s ISMs, which are the foundation of Rocket and explain the soul of our company. Mr.&nbsp;Cooper&#146;s purpose of keeping the dream of homeownership alive fits nicely in Rocket&#146;s mission to Help Everyone Home.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As I shared with the Rocket organization, we are creating the first-ever integrated&nbsp;homeownership platform in America. Over my time in the space, my
&#147;aha moment&#148; was realizing that a homeownership platform is built from three main parts: home search, mortgage origination and servicing, and that no one has dared to connect them&nbsp;and create a network effect.</P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Redfin, our other recent acquisition announcement, will accelerate our growth in search and real estate <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap"><FONT
STYLE="white-space:nowrap">top-of-funnel.</FONT></FONT> By combining Rocket and Mr.&nbsp;Cooper, we will take major leaps forward in both origination and servicing, allowing us to make homeownership more accessible for consumers across all 50
states. One super funnel.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I want to also emphasize that you are a critical factor to the success of the combined company and our ability to deliver on our
vision. Over the next several months, our teams will work together to develop a thoughtful integration plan that builds on our collective strengths and learnings from each other.</P>

continue benefiting from Jay&#146;s leadership as he works alongside me as President and CEO of Rocket Mortgage.</P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Thanks for everything you have done to
make Mr.&nbsp;Cooper such a great company and the perfect fit to join Rocket as we accelerate our pursuit of building America&#146;s first homeownership platform together.</P>
