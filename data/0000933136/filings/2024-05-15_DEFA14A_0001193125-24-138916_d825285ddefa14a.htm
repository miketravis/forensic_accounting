instrumental in overseeing operations and implementing process improvements resulting in higher profitability and enhanced customer experience To support a smooth and orderly transition of his role and responsibilities, we&#8217;ve secured his
employment as Vice Chairman through the end of 2024 Under his employment agreement, Mr. Marshall&#8217;s total target direct compensation remains the same, but the mix of cash and equity, and form of equity, has changed, with a higher emphasis on
incentive cash and time-based restricted stock units, to reflect his role and to incentivize him to remain through the transition to his successor Mr. Bray is a demonstrated leader whose strategic vision and deep knowledge of our business and
industry make him uniquely qualified to unlock the next phase of growth for the Company Since Mr. Bray became CEO of Mr. Cooper&#8217;s predecessor company in 2012, he has delivered exceptional results, executed on several strategic initiatives and
grown our servicing portfolio The employment agreement and a one-time equity award incentivizes Mr. Bray to continue to serve during this important time while creating long-term value for our shareholders Chris Marshall, Vice Chairman &amp; Former
