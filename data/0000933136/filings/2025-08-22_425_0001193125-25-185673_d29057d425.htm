<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">As previously disclosed, on March&nbsp;31, 2025, Mr.&nbsp;Cooper Group Inc. (&#8220;Mr.&nbsp;Cooper&#8221;), Rocket Companies, Inc.
(&#8220;Rocket&#8221;), Maverick Merger Sub, Inc., a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket (&#8220;Maverick Merger Subsidiary&#8221;), and Maverick Merger Sub 2, LLC, a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket (&#8220;Forward Merger
Subsidiary&#8221;), entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#8220;Merger Agreement&#8221;), pursuant to which, among other things and subject to the terms and conditions therein, Maverick Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into
Mr.&nbsp;Cooper, with Mr.&nbsp;Cooper surviving as a direct, wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket (the &#8220;Maverick Merger&#8221;), and immediately following such Maverick Merger, Mr.&nbsp;Cooper will merge with and into Forward Merger Subsidiary,
with Forward Merger Subsidiary surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of Rocket (together with the Maverick Merger, the &#8220;Mergers&#8221;). Mr.&nbsp;Cooper filed a definitive proxy statement (the &#8220;Proxy Statement&#8221;) with the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission on July&nbsp;31, 2025 for the solicitation of proxies in connection with the special meeting of Mr. Cooper&#8217;s stockholders, to be held on September&nbsp;3, 2025, to vote upon, among other things, matters
necessary to complete the Mergers. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B><I>Litigation Related to the Mergers </I></B></P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In connection with the Mergers, three complaints have been filed by purported stockholders of Mr.&nbsp;Cooper in the Supreme Court of the State
of New York: <I>McDaniels </I>v. <I>Mr.</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;Cooper Group Inc., et al.</I>, Index No.&nbsp;654690 (filed in New York County on August&nbsp;6, 2025), <I>Clark </I>v. <I>Mr.</I><I></I><I>&nbsp;Cooper Group Inc., et al.</I>, Index
No.&nbsp;654699 (filed in New York County on August&nbsp;7, 2025), and <I>Garfield </I>v.<I> Bon Salle, et al.</I>, Index No.&nbsp;617022 (filed in Nassau County on August&nbsp;7, 2025). The complaints allege, among other things, that the Proxy
Statement contains purported misstatements and omissions in violation of state laws and seek, among other things, an injunction enjoining the shareholder vote on the Mergers and/or consummation of the Mergers and the other transactions contemplated
by the Merger Agreement. Additional lawsuits arising out of the Mergers or the Proxy Statement may also be filed in the future. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">In
addition to these lawsuits, a number of other purported stockholders of Mr.&nbsp;Cooper have sent demand letters alleging similar deficiencies regarding the disclosures made in the Proxy Statement. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">All of the defendants named in the matters believe that the allegations in the complaints and demand letters are without merit. While the
defendants believe that the disclosures set forth in the Proxy Statement comply fully with applicable law, to moot the plaintiffs&#8217; disclosure claims and to avoid nuisance, potential expense and delay, Mr.&nbsp;Cooper has determined to
voluntarily supplement the Proxy Statement with the below disclosures. Nothing in the below supplemental disclosures shall be deemed an admission of the legal necessity or materiality under applicable law of any of the disclosures set forth herein
or in the Proxy Statement. To the contrary, all defendants deny all allegations in the complaints and demand letters and that any additional disclosures were or are required in the Proxy Statement. </P>

<P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:4%; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Mr.&nbsp;Cooper is supplementing the Proxy Statement with certain additional information set forth below. These disclosures should be read in
connection with the Proxy Statement, which should be read in its entirety. All page references are to pages in the Proxy Statement, and terms used below, unless otherwise defined, have the meanings set forth in the Proxy Statement. The information
contained herein speaks only as of August&nbsp;22, 2025, unless the information indicates another date applies. For clarity, new text within restated paragraphs from the Proxy Statement is highlighted with <B><U>bold, underlined text</U></B>. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The disclosures on page 17 and page 20 of the Proxy Statement are hereby supplemented by adding the below text at the end of the sections under the heading
&#8220;Governance Structure of Rocket Following the Mergers&#8221; and &#8220;Board of Directors of Rocket Following the Maverick Merger&#8221;: </B></P>

a party to any confidentiality agreement with a standstill applicable to Mr.&nbsp;Cooper that included a &#8220;don&#8217;t ask, don&#8217;t waive&#8221; provision. </P>
<P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The disclosure on page 69 of the Proxy Statement is hereby supplemented by replacing the text of the portion of the first paragraph on such page that

Mr.&nbsp;Cooper Board was also aware, Citi and its affiliates in the past have provided, currently are providing and in the future may provide investment banking, commercial banking and other similar financial services to Rocket and/or certain of
its affiliates<B> </B>unrelated to the mergers, for which services Citi and such affiliates have received and expect to receive compensation, including, without limitation, having acted and acting as a lender under a certain credit facility of a
subsidiary of Rocket, and having provided, and providing, certain residential financing and securitization services to a subsidiary of Rocket, and certain issuer services <B><U>and treasury and trade solutions</U></B> to Rocket and/or certain of its
affiliates. For the services described above for Rocket and/or certain of its affiliates, Citi and its affiliates received, during the <FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">two-year</FONT> period prior to the date of Citi&#8217;s opinion, aggregate fees
and net interest income of approximately $14&nbsp;million from Rocket and/or certain of its affiliates.&nbsp;Based on the nature of its relationships with Rocket and the information that was available to Citi as of the date of its opinion, Citi
estimates that for the services described above that Citi and its affiliates are currently providing to Rocket and/or certain of its affiliates, the aggregate fees that Citi and its affiliates may receive, during the
<FONT STYLE="white-space:nowrap">one-year</FONT> period following the date of Citi&#8217;s opinion, from Rocket and/or certain of its affiliates will be less than the fees payable to Citi by Mr.&nbsp;Cooper for its services in connection with the
mergers. The actual amount of aggregate fees that Citi may receive in the future for the services described above that Citi and its affiliates are currently providing to Rocket and/or certain of its affiliates might be materially different for
various reasons, including, among other things, as a result of conditions in the markets in which Rocket operates or domestic, foreign or global economic conditions generally. In the ordinary course of Citi&#8217;s business, Citi and its affiliates
may actively trade or hold the securities of Mr.&nbsp;Cooper and Rocket for Citi&#8217;s own account or for the account of its customers and, accordingly, may at any time hold a long or short position in such securities. In addition, Citi and its
affiliates (including Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates) may maintain relationships with Mr.&nbsp;Cooper, Rocket and their respective affiliates. As of March&nbsp;25, 2025, Citi held, on a proprietary basis, less than 1.0% of the outstanding equity
securities of (i)&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Cooper and (ii)&nbsp;Rocket, respectively. <B><U>For the avoidance of doubt, all references to &#8220;Rocket and/or certain of its affiliates&#8221;, including the penultimate sentence referring to Rocket&#8217;s
affiliates in this paragraph, shall be deemed to include Rock Holdings, Inc. as an affiliate.</U></B>&#8221; </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:18pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman"><B>The disclosure on page 76 of the Proxy
