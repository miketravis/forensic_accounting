<P STYLE="margin-top:6pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Good morning, everyone. We look forward to sharing our thoughts on our first quarter financial results, but first, I want to note that due to the pending
combination with Rocket, which was announced on March&nbsp;31, we will not be taking questions this morning. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">I&#146;ll start my comments with some
personal thoughts on the combination with Rocket. This transaction is about creating a scaled homeownership experience. By pooling our talent, data, and technology, we are going to totally reimagine the homeownership journey from start to finish and
harness the transformative power of AI to bring our customers a truly amazing experience. </P> <P STYLE="margin-top:12pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">For our investors, the industrial logic is compelling, and this
transaction presents the opportunity for our shareholders to participate in the upside of the combined company. At Mr.&nbsp;Cooper, we&#146;ve worked for years to perfect our servicing platform, which is digital, efficient, and highly scalable. Our
multi-decade track record of customer growth and resilient profitability speaks for itself, as does the accolades for operational excellence we&#146;ve earned from investors and clients. Now, by combining our platform with Rocket&#146;s iconic brand
and marketing capabilities, we&#146;re creating a fully integrated homeownership platform with unmatched capabilities. </P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0pt; margin-bottom:0pt; font-size:10pt; font-family:Times New Roman">Finally, as I&#146;ve shared before, the two cultures are very complementary, and the integration teams are
already synched and planning for how to bring our businesses together once the transaction closes. I could not be more thrilled to be part of this joint effort to usher in the industry&#146;s future. </P>

and marketing skills, its leading JD Powers service levels, its highly scalable origination platform, and our shared commitment to investing in AI, digital and other technologies, there&#146;s so much more we will be able to do for customers over
time, whether it&#146;s through refi&#146;s, second liens, purchase mortgages, title insurance, or closing services. We think the combination will create a true
